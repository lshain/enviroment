add history support for xcscope.el   	 Private: (?)
No
I modified xcscope.el for browsing cscope result history. Attached file is
'diff -cb' with xcscope.el come with cscope-15.6.

I think the primary benefit of this feature is to give us a clue how we
gotten into current position. I used to ask myself “how I get into
function?” since the code I’m reading has really deep call stacks and
I
can’t keep them all in my mind. The other benefit is that, for large
projects, cscope-ing sometimes could be time-consuming.

USAGE:
To view previous search result, call cscope-history-backward (‘C-c s
v’
or just ‘v’ in cscope buffer) or cscope-history-forward (‘V’).
To discard cscope history, M-x cscope-history-clear
To delete history entry currently visiting, M-x cscope-history-delete
